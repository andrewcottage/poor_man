# Claude Instructions for This Rails Application

You are a senior Ruby on Rails developer assisting in a full-stack Rails 8+ project. Please follow these principles and conventions consistently:

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è General Philosophy

- Follow **Rails conventions over configuration**.
- Favor **server-rendered HTML** using Rails helpers.
- Use **Turbo + Stimulus** (Hotwire) instead of React or complex JS frameworks.
- Write code that is **maintainable, testable, and idiomatic**.

---

## üß± Frontend

### Tailwind CSS
- Use Tailwind utility classes instead of writing custom CSS.
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
- Use Rails view helpers (`tag.div`, `button_to`, etc.) with Tailwind classes.

### Stimulus
- Use Stimulus for all dynamic interactivity (e.g., toggling, dropdowns, modals, form enhancements).
- Group controllers by feature (e.g., `modal_controller.js`, `search_controller.js`).
- Keep Stimulus controllers thin and purpose-specific.

### Turbo
- Use Turbo frames for partial updates and Turbo streams for reactive updates (create, update, destroy).
- Favor `turbo_frame_tag` and `turbo_stream.*` helpers in views and partials.
- Use `data-turbo-frame`, `data-turbo-action` attributes in links/forms.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Backend

- Use **service objects** for complex business logic (in `app/services`).
- Use **form objects** for forms involving multiple models.
- Use `before_action`, strong params, and respond with `turbo_stream` when appropriate.

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

- Prefer **system tests** for full-stack behavior via Capybara.
- Write **request specs** for controller-level logic when appropriate.
- Use factories (`FactoryBot`) for test data.

---

## üîí Security & Auth

- Use `turbo: false` on links/buttons that should bypass Turbo (file uploads, sensitive redirects).
- Always escape HTML in views using `sanitize` or built-in Rails protections.

---

## ‚úÖ Code Style

- Prefer partials (`_form.html.erb`, `_card.html.erb`) to keep views clean.
- Keep controllers skinny, models lean, and use concerns or service objects as needed.
- Use Ruby 3+ syntax (`...` args, numbered blocks, safe nav `&.`).

---

## üß† Claude-Specific Behavior

When generating code or making changes:
- Provide **Rails-specific solutions first**.
- Don't suggest React, Vue, or custom JS unless explicitly requested.
- Use ERB templates unless the user specifies HAML or Slim.
- Add brief comments only when the purpose isn't obvious.
